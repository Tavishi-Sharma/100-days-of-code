Selection sort isa sorting algorithmthat selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.

Working of selection sort:-
Let A is an array with elements:- {9,3,7,0,2}
i)Set first element as minimum, here it is 9.
ii)Compare the nminimum with second element.
   If second element is smaller then minimum, then set second element as minimum
   In this case, 3<9 .So, new minimum is 3.
   Again comparing it with next element which is 7, 3 is smaller than 7. So, minimum would remain same.
   Compare with next 0<3. So new minimum is 0.
   Compare witn next 0<2. Minimum is 0.
iii)swap(9,0)
Now the array is like:- 0,3,7,9,2
Now take second element as minimum i.e. 3 compare it with the next element which is 7.3<7 so minimum will not change.
Compare 3 with next element which is 9, but 3<9 so minimum will not change.
Comapre 3 with next which is 2, 2<3 so new minimum will be 2.We have come to the end of the array
swap minimum and second element i.e. swap(3,2)
Array:- 0,2,7,9,3
Take 3rd element as minimum i.e. 7 compare with next which is 9. Since 7<9, minimum will not change.
Compare with next which is 3. 3<7 so, minimum will be 3.
swap(7,3)
Array:-0,2,3,9,7
Take 4th element as minimum i.e. 9 compare with next which is 7.Since 7<9, minimum will be 7.Nothing to compare next. 
So, swap(9,7)
Sorted Array:- 0,2,3,7,9.

Sample test case 1:-{0,0,0}
Output:-0,0,0

Sample test case 2:-{-1,-2,-3,-4}
Output:-{-4,-3,-2,-1}
